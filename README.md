# LocalsOnly

## What is LocalsOnly?

A Yelp like website with the focus on locals to add input about businesses and places of interest.
Focusing on the locals enables organic reach and growth to the community. Rather than allowing those
who are passing through town, allowing the locals to be the primary input gives a more honest and open
in-site to the community around them and allows any newcomers to see the community they have joined.
This website also encourages people to get out and interact with the community and not focus on
maintaining a digital community.

## Why is LocalsOnly being developed?

This is a 2 part response

### Part 1

This concept came about when I first moved to Arizona. Like many people coming to a new place; I wanted
to "become" a local. This meant that I needed to see what is popular among the locals, where they like to
hang out, etc. I also wanted to become apart of the community rather than online groups. There are plenty
of places online for this through various social medias, but I wanted a place where this concept is the
focus. The focus being a place for locals to engage with each other and a place for newcomers to jump in.

### Part 2

I have been developing in various small projects over the last few years, some on my own and others for
university courses. I wanted to start working on bigger projects and also delve into web development.
This website started with myself having no knowledge on the subject. This is also a project where I invite
others to join and learn about web development. My goal is to guide this site into a company to further
support those who want to learn and grow into the world of web development.

## How to get the site up and running

Make sure you have node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can check this by running `node --version` and `npm --version`. If either give you an error, please install by going [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Clone the __Dev__ repo, then run on both client and server separately `npm install`.

After all the dependencies are installed, have two terminals open and move into the server and client directory. In the server terminal run `npm run dev` then go into the client terminal and run `npm start`. Let me know to approve you into the dev team and then I will give the .env files. Pun the server and client .env files in their respective locations. You must then make an account, after which let me know and I will make you into an admin.
